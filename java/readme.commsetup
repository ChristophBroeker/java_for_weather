To install the comm libraries

1. place the dll from the kit into jdk home/jre/bin
2. place comm.jar into home/jre/lib/ext
3. place the properties file into home/jre/lib

for linux on 1.5, you have to copy the jcl.jar from the 1.4 dist into jre/lib/ext - a bug

when using the usb-serial adapter, it installs itself as /dev/ttyUSB0 - create a symlink to it from another /dev/TTY
entry and link to that
