<html><head></head><body><pre>        + Here is how to create a weather station update to wunderground.com:

                -------------------

                Here is the URL used in the uploading (if you go here without parameters
                you will get a brief usage):
                http://weatherstation.wunderground.com/weatherstation/updateweatherstation.php

                Here is the usage that will be displayed with blank parameters:
                usage
                action [action=updateraw]
                ID [ID as registered by wunderground.com]
                PASSWORD [PASSWORD registered with this ID]
                dateutc - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (mysql format)]
                winddir - [0-360]
                windspeedmph - [mph]
                windgustmph - [windgustmph ]
                humidity - [%]
                tempf - [temperature F]
                rainin - [rain in (hourly)] -- the accumulated rainfall in the past 60 mins
				dailyrainin - [rain so far today in localtime]
                baromin - [barom in]
                dewptf- [dewpoint F]
                weather - [text] -- metar style (+RA)
                clouds - [text] -- SKC, FEW, SCT, BKN, OVC
                soiltempf - [temp F]
                soilmoisture - [%]
                leafwetness  - [%]
                solarradiation - [MJ/m^2]
                UV - [index]
                visibility - [nm]
                softwaretype - [text] ie: vws or weatherdisplay

        + Here is an example of a full URL:

http://weatherstation.wunderground.com/weatherstation/updateweatherstation.php?ID=KCASANFR5&amp;PASSWORD=sunfish&amp;dateutc=2000-01-01+10%3A32%3A35&amp;winddir=230&amp;windspeedmph=12&amp;w
indgustmph=12&amp;tempf=70&amp;rainin=0&amp;baromin=29.1&amp;dewptf=68.2&amp;humidity=90&amp;weather=&amp;clouds=&amp;softwaretype=vws%20versionxx&amp;action=updateraw

                NOTE: not all fields need to be set

NEW -- realtime updates:
A real-time update should look almost like the standard update.
However, the server to request is:

rtupdate.wunderground.com, not weatherstation.wunderground.com

And, please add to the query string:
realtime=1&amp;rtfreq=2.5
where rtrfreq is the frequency of updates in seconds.

We haven't decided whether you should also send standard updates if
the user is uploading in real-time.  For now, I think we are leaning
toward either only sending standard updates, or only sending real-time
updates, not requiring that both are sent when the user is in
real-time mode.  That'll be simpler.
