Hi Tom,
 
Byte 86 will contain 8 bits obviously 
(for each of the eight possible transmitter IDs). 
Each bit will be represented by a 0 or 1 depending 
on whether or not the battery voltage is within the 
threshold value. So, I suspect that bit 0 will 
represent ID1, bit 1 will represent ID2, etc..
 
The battery threshold for the Vantage Pro I ISS is 2.7v.
 
I hope that this information is helpful, let me know if 
you need any additional assistance.
 
Best Regards,
